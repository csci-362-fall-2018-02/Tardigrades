========================
HTTP Callbacks for Teams
========================

Enterprise customers can register a URL for http callbacks so that activity on their
teams will fire an HTTP POST requests to that URL.

To register your Team to receive HTTP notifications, please send your request
to us at enterprise@amara.org and we will set it up for you. You can also
contact us with inquiry about any custom notifications that are not listed in
our general offering below.

Please indicate a URL where youâ€™d like to get notified. Each team can have
their own URL, or a common URL can be used for several teams. We recommend
that the selected URL uses HTTPS protocol for safer communication.

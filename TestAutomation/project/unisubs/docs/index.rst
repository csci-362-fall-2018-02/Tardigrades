The source code to Amara is available on `Github
<https://github.com/pculture/unisubs>`_.  Feel free to fork the project and
open a pull request.

Before working on a sizeable feature, please do run it by us in our IRC
channel.  We don't want you to waste your time working on something we don't
really want.  We are at ``#amara`` on freenode.
